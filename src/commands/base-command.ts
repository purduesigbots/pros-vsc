    I realize I missed something quite important in the presentation. It's the idea of synchronous v.s. asynchronous functions.

    In short, a synchronous function is one that blocks the execution of the program until it completes. 
    An asynchronous function is one that does not block the execution of the program until it completes.

    The way this works is that when either function is called, it waits until something is returned to it.
    However, in the case of an asynchronous function, it will return a promise. 
    This promise is a placeholder for the value that will be returned later.

    This is how javascript enables having multiple things happen at once, since by design, javascript is single-threaded.

    However, we might not always want to have multiple tasks happening at the same time.
    This is where the await keyword comes in.

    The await keyword will wait for the promise to be resolved before continuing the execution of the program.

    In this project, almost every function you should write will be asynchronous.
